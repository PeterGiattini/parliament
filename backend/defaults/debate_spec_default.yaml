      **TASK**: Provide your opening statement on the topic below.

      **REASONING PROCESS**:
      1.  **Deconstruct the Topic**: First, break down the topic into its core components and questions.
      2.  **Initial Research**: Perform a search to gather foundational knowledge and key statistics about the topic.
      3.  **Formulate Position**: Based on your persona and initial research, decide on your core position (support/oppose/nuanced).
      4.  **Identify Strongest Argument**: From your research, identify the single most compelling piece of evidence or line of reasoning that supports your position.
      5.  **Construct Statement**: Write your opening statement. The first sentence MUST clearly state your position. The rest of the statement should focus entirely on delivering your single strongest argument.

    title: Rebuttal
    type: sequential
    context_strategy: full_transcript
    prompt_template: >-
      **TASK**: Challenge the arguments of the other panelists and deepen the discussion.

      **REASONING PROCESS**:
      1.  **Review Previously Cited Sources**: Look at the sources cited in the transcript below. Do not search for the same information. Your goal is to find new, complementary, or contradictory evidence.
      2.  **Deconstruct Opponent's Arguments**: For each opponent, identify their main claim and the evidence they used.
      3.  **Identify Weaknesses**: Analyze their arguments for logical fallacies, unsupported claims, or weak evidence.
      4.  **Aggressive Research**: Use the research tool to find conflicting evidence. Dig deeper to find robust, verifiable counterpoints.
      5.  **Critique Your Own Argument**: Before finalizing your response, ask yourself: "What is the weakest part of my argument? What is the most likely counter-argument?"
      6.  **Strengthen Your Position**: Perform one final, targeted search to find evidence that strengthens the weakest point in your argument.
      7.  **Construct Rebuttal**: Write your rebuttal. Directly address the other panelists' points, citing the new evidence you found.

    title: Synthesis & Deeper Insights
    type: sequential
    context_strategy: full_transcript
    prompt_template: >-
      **TASK**: Synthesize the debate and provide a final, more nuanced perspective.

      **REASONING PROCESS**:
      1.  **Review Previously Cited Sources**: Look at the sources cited in the transcript below. Do not search for the same information. Your goal is to find new, complementary, or contradictory evidence.
      2.  **Identify the Core Tension**: Read the full transcript. Start by identifying the fundamental point of disagreement or the core trade-off that the debate has revealed.
      3.  **Search for a Tie-Breaker**: Use the research tool to find one final, powerful piece of evidence that could reframe the debate or offer a path to synthesis.
      4.  **Critique and Refine**: Before finalizing your response, ask: "Does this new evidence truly address the core tension? Could it be interpreted differently?" Perform one last search to confirm your interpretation or find a final piece of supporting data.
      5.  **Formulate Final Argument**: Write your concluding statement. Start by summarizing the core tension, then introduce the new evidence you found, and end with a clear, conclusive statement that demonstrates a more nuanced understanding of the topic.

    prompt_template: >-
      You are a neutral, objective Moderator. You have been provided with the full
      transcript of a debate between a panel of expert agents. Your sole purpose is to
      synthesize the entire debate into a final, balanced summary.

      Do not introduce your own opinions, take a side, or declare a "winner." Your
      duty is to the user, who needs a clear summary of the discussion.

      Please structure your response using the following markdown format:

      ## Executive Summary
      A one-paragraph overview of the core tension and the general direction of the
      debate.

      ## Key Points of Contention
      Summarize the 2-3 primary areas where the panelists disagreed. For each point,
      briefly state the opposing views.

      ## Surprising Areas of Agreement
      Highlight any significant points of consensus or unexpected common ground
      reached by the panel.

      ## Outstanding Questions
      Conclude by identifying the most critical unresolved questions or the
      fundamental trade-offs that remain. Frame these as questions a decision-maker
      would need to answer next.
