    title: Opening Statements
    type: parallel
    context_strategy: topic_only
    prompt_template: >-
      Please provide your opening statement on the following topic. Lead with your
      strongest, most compelling argument immediately after stating your position:
  "2":
    title: Rebuttal
    type: sequential
    context_strategy: full_transcript
    prompt_template: >-
      You have already provided your opening statement. Below are the opening
      statements from the other members of the panel.

      Your task is to now engage with their arguments.

      CRITICAL: Your response MUST be from your own assigned persona. Do NOT invent,
      impersonate, or generate responses for any other panelists, especially those not
      present in the provided statements below.

      CRITICAL: You must argue consistently with the core position you took in Round 1.
      Your goal is to defend your initial stance while critiquing others. Do not
      fundamentally change your overall position (support/oppose).

      Critique: Directly address the points made by the other panelists that conflict
      with your principles or analysis. Identify specific flaws in their reasoning.

      Acknowledge & Reinforce: To make your arguments more credible, you may
      acknowledge valid points made by other panelists (even those you generally
      disagree with). Explain how their point actually reinforces your own position or
      helps clarify the true point of disagreement.

      Refine: Briefly refine your own position based on this new information, but
      maintain your core stance.

      Your response should be a direct contribution to the ongoing debate, not a new
      opening statement. Be concise and targeted.
  "3":
    title: Surrebuttal
    type: sequential
    context_strategy: full_transcript
    prompt_template: >-
      You have now participated in both opening statements and rebuttal rounds. Below
      are the rebuttal responses from the other panelists, which may have critiqued
      your original position.

      Your task is to provide a final defense of your core position.

      CRITICAL: This is your last opportunity to defend your original stance. You must
      remain consistent with your Round 1 position while addressing the specific
      critiques leveled against you.

      Defend & Clarify: Address the specific criticisms of your arguments. Explain why
      your position remains valid despite these critiques. Clarify any
      misunderstandings of your original points.

      Strengthen: Reinforce your strongest arguments with additional reasoning or
      evidence. Show why your position is still the most compelling despite the
      counter-arguments.

      Conclude: End with a clear, confident restatement of your core position. This
      should be your final word on why your stance is correct.

      Your response should be a strong, final defense that leaves no doubt about where
      you stand. Be concise but thorough.
